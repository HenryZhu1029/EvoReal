    ### Task Objective:
    {problem_desc}


    ### Function Description:
    All generated new python code must follow this function signature as the first line of python function:
    {func_desc}
  
    ### Function Signature:
    {func_signature}
  
    ### Design Guidance:
    - Design generation strategies that reflect spatial complexity, distributional realism, and diverse patterns across samples.
    - Encourage variability across samples: avoid excessive reuse of the same generation logic or structure.

    ### Reference Module:
    {seed}
