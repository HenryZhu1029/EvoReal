The goal is to design a CVRP customer postion generator - a Python function that outputs synthetic CVRP customer coordinates postions for fine-tuning a neural solver. The generated problems should not merely be valid or diverse, but should exhibit structural patterns that are highly representative of a specific class of CVRPLib distributions. The generator should produce a well-formed set of customer coordinates of fixed problem size n and exhibit strong generalization on real CVRPLib problems of the same type, serving as an abstract yet effective summary of the target distribution's geometric and distributional characteristics.
