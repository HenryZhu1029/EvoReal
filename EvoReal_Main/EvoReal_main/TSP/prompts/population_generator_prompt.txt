    ### Task Objective:
    {problem_desc}

    ### Function Name:
    {func_name}
    
    ### Function Description:
    All generated new python code must follow this function signature as the first line of python function:
    {func_desc}
  
    ### Function Signature:
    {func_signature}
  
    ### Design Guidance:
    - Design generation strategies that reflect spatial complexity, distributional realism, and diverse patterns across samples.
    - Encourage variability across samples: avoid excessive reuse of the same generation logic or structure.

    ### Reference Module:
    {seed} 
    Before returning `all_points`, you must guarantee that each sample contains exactly `problem_size` 2D coordinates by either truncating (via `torch.randperm`) or padding (via `torch.cat` + `torch.rand`).
    Ensure all tensors have shape `(problem_size, 2)` and are stackable across batch dimension. Refer to the seed function above for how to pad or truncate.
