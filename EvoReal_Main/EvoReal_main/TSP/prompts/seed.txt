Your design for the code should align with the design guidance below:
{external_guide}

seed generator:
{seed_func}

This module(python function) illustrates how to call PyTorch APIs (e.g., `torch.rand`, `torch.cat`, `torch.randperm`, `torch.linspace`) in a safe and modular way. 
You may refer to the trivial module above for inspiration but you should explore more logic, generation strategies, or substructures compositions to create new `{func_name}`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```
