The goal is to design a TSP problem data generator - a Python function that outputs synthetic TSP instances for fine-tuning a neural solver. The generated problems should not merely be valid or diverse, but should exhibit structural patterns that are highly representative of a specific class of TSPLib distributions. This includes capturing repeated motifs, geometric arrangements, directional or symmetric alignments, and other spatial regularities. The generator should produce well-formed instances of fixed problem size and exhibit strong generalization on real TSPLib problems of the same type, serving as an abstract yet effective summary of the target distribution's geometric and distributional characteristics.
